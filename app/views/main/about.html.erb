    <p class='center'>GavelRank is a site meant to centralize the often times hard to find and quantify high school Model United Nations 
        Conferences held accross the country. Teams can create events, track their scores, and find conferences near them to participate in. 
        GavelRank was created by Brandon Wong, Chris Issing, and Alex Cabrera during the HACKTJ hackathon.</p>
